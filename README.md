# lacuna-log-processing
This project represents a Python script for processing a single CSV logfile from an annotation tool.

## requires
Python 3+ with gensim and stop_words installed. Likely the Anaconda distribution.

## running
The main scripts are **logfileLacuna.py** .

## code
**logfileLacuna.py** reads in the file from CSV, maneuvers other classes to get the topic modeling and similarities, and then writes out to CSV

**topicModelLDA.py** an internal class for creating an LDA topic model and predicting the topic of future documents. Also contains a convenient method for cleaning unwanted characters from a string and turning it into a bag of words to be fed to the model. Will eventually have functionality for calculating similarity between two strings.

**NoteInstance.py** an internal class representing one usage of the annotation system: the users involved, the passage highlighted, annotation made, context, title of article, manual codes, etc.

## logfiles
Note: The logfiles contained in this github repository are simulated and not the real data gathered from the study
- **combine_final_codes.csv:**
